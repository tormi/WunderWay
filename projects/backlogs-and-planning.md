Project requirements are documented in **backlogs**. There is the overall **product backlog** that contains all requirements. We also create **sprint backlogs** that contain the requirements for each iteration.

Requirements are written as **user stories** using the format:

As a [ *user* ],

I want [ *requirement* ],

so that [ *value gained* ]

We use this format to fully describe who wants what and to understand the value that will be delivered by the story. If something will not deliver real value then it shouldn't be a priority.

## Product Backlog

The product backlog lists all of the requirements that the client has specified. The product backlog is owned by them (the Product Owner) and it’s their responsibility (supported by the Scrum Master and the Project Director) to order the backlog in priority order, with those items delivering the most value first.

We use <a href="https://rally1.rallydev.com">Rally</a> to manage our backlogs. Each project is provided with it's own Rally instance and members of the project team (Wunderkraut and the client) are provided with access.

When the project first reaches this stage the Scrummaster will prepare the Rally account for the team.

## Sprint Planning, Sprint Backlog & Estimation Accuracy

The project is delivered in iterations, referred to as sprints. The length of each sprint is agreed during the project initiation but is generally between 2-4 weeks.

Each sprint selects stories from the backlog, those with the highest priority and adds them to the sprint backlog.

###Sprint Backlog

The sprint backlog is comprised of stories selected from the main product backlog. It includes those stories that will deliver against the objectives for the particular sprint that the Product Owner has defined.

The Scrum Master and Product Owner will typically work on requirements 1 or 2 sprints ahead of the development. These priority stories are moved to the top of the backlog. The stories are then reviewed to ensure that they're well written and that they describe the requirements clearly. It's important to prepare the stories well for the sprint planning session.

Before the next (or first) sprint can begin, a senior developer will scout the product backlog, looking at these priority user stories. Any ambiguity will be addressed at this point to make the description of each user story very clear. Some user stories will include a reference to supporting documentation or other material. The senior developer will confirm that all of the user stories are complete and that the team will be able to understand and estimate against them.

###Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is all about selecting stories from the backlog and discussing them with the team to make sure they're able to deliver them within a sprint.

Sprint planning takes place in two halves. The first half (limited to 4 hours) is where the Product Owner selects and describes the stories and the objectives for the sprint. The objectives help the team understand why certain stories have been selected and helps them understand what they'll demonstrate at the end of the sprint. In the first session the team do high level estimates on the stories.

In the second session (limited to 4 hours again), the team break the stories down into tasks and estimate those to make sure the original story estimates were correct.

When the planning is complete and the team are happy with the stories for the sprint we finish the planning phase and move to development.

###Story sizing

We estimate stories relative to other stories. When placing a story next to another it becomes quite obvious which is the bigger story. We use this method to understand whether a story is worth 1 point, 2, 3 or 5.

###When is a sprint full?

We estimate stories using points on the Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8 etc). The number selected represents the amount of effort a story is likely to require.

We continually monitor the number of points that a team can deliver and use our own history to understand the amount of effort we're likely to deliver in a sprint.


###Estimate Accuracy

The accuracy of estimates is very important to quality as this sets the expectations with the client. We record our estimates for each sprint and compare these with the actual effort at the end of the sprint. Where there are discrepancies we try to understand the reasons behind this so we can look to improve in the next sprint.

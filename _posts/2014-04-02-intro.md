title: Introducing WunderWay
---

The WunderWay is a collection of all the ways in which we work — the way we run the business, the way we deliver our projects, and the way we carry out our day to day work.

Anyone in the company can edit this site via the github repository. Inline with our 'open by default' approach, this site is published on the web for anyone to read, and anyone can clone and use the repository to help with their own business (Under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license).

title: Winning Clients - Discovery
---

First - properly read any documentation we have been sent by the client.

Then, gather and review as much information as you can on:

- Client background: company profile, client team members, individual profiles
- Who the buyers are (see below)
- Project requirements and restrictions, terms and conditions – are there any deal-breakers, problem points or alarm bells?
- Timeline, for the proposal and the project – are both achievable with the resources we have available?
- Budget – is it viable? Do we need to have an early conversation about costs and value? If the client won't give us even an indication of budget, is it worth proceeding?
- Client market and industry
- Our competitors for the work – what are their strengths and weaknesses? how can we counter their value propositions? how well placed are we to win in comparison?

- Fit with Wunder brand – does the client have the approach, personality, standards, brand we want to work with?
- Potential for long term partnership - is the client interested in developing a long term relationship with us, or do they simply want a one-shot project. Is it worth proceeding if it's only a one-shot?
- Chances of winning – taking everything into account, is it even worth putting the time into a proposal? Some procurements are simply a lottery, some procurement processes don't allow us to show our strengths, some just look for cheapest bid. Let's not waste time on these.

Remember we can gather information from our networks, too:

- Other people in the Wunder group outside this proposal
- People with experience of the client or the industry
- Members of the Drupal, Agile or other industry-related communities
- Other contacts outside our company and our industry who can inform our decision

## Write Epics For The Project
This will enable us to get an idea for the size and scope of the project, and to develop better estimates. Develop the epics as a team when reading through the client documentation.
These epics should eventually be included in the proposal, but make very clear that these are just our assumptions and current best understanding of the project. They WILL change as proper user research and discovery is done.

## Understand Our Buyers
Targeting buyers is not just a matter of knowing their names. We need to understand their motivations, and their influence on the decision, if we’re to appeal to the right people in the right way.

Types of Buyers:

### Project sponsor
This is the person signing off the spend. They usually sit at a high level in the organization.

- What are their perspectives on the project, and what will make them choose us?
- What risks do they perceive and prioritise?
- Is this project sponsor a technical person?
- Are they only a rubber-stamper taking a recommendation from technical colleagues, or might they override technical opinion?
- Consider how the shift towards web budgets coming under the CMO affects this client. Will it change their perspective and how we need to respond?

### Economic buyer
This person makes a recommendation to the colleague signing off. They need to make a business case in order to exert influence – a job we need to make easy for them.

### Technical buyer
The person who has their eye on the technical detail of how the solution will work.

- Do they have preferences for, or prejudices against, particular systems from past projects?

### Influencer
This person can make huge difference to the choice – they may have influence but not have management power. For example, a web editor who will use the system day to day.

### Procurement
In some cases the procurement person can really lead the process, and be very pro-active. In other cases this person can just be an influencer, without holding any real power. It’s important to know their true role in the process and if we can build a direct relationship with other buyers too.

### Client connector
Someone within the client who was the reason you were invited to pitch, perhaps a social contact, from the Drupal community, or someone closer to you than the other buyers.
This person can provide client insight you might not normally get, and can make a big difference to the outcome.


## The Buyer Campaign
We need to activate all of the people voting on or influencing a bid decision. It’s best to reach them before the proposal stage, and in a non-proposal setting. This is particularly relevant in cases when we’re targeting clients for future work, developing long-term relationships and watching for bigger opportunities.

Approach this by reviewing our list of contacts and noting down ways to make connections ahead of time – through industry or technical meetups, by organizing forums ourselves, or hosting training days. This helps us break out of RFP process, develop relationships that further the Wunder brand, and attract a better class of customer.

Get the inside track on who is involved in the decision-making on the pitches, and exactly who those people are. Look within the Wunder companies for connections with individual customers, BUT beware of very close connections and conflicts of interest – these could have a negative effect in some situations.

In a client meeting, the first person to speak often holds a lot of influence in the decision. Watch who on the client side talks first and look for ways to influence them. Alternatively, look for ways to change who speaks first to improve the dynamics for us.

Ask the client what criteria they have for their decision. Most customers will tell you – those who can’t, hesitate or give different answers to RFP requirements are unlikely to actually be in charge of the decision.

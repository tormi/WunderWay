title: Security

Security is a top priority for all our clients. We have experience of developing for national governments, public sector organisations, and for financial services organisations such as an online bank and the SWIFT international payments organisation.

Drupal is highly-rated for its security, so has been used for projects from the White House website, to building a structure used to protect the personal data of Al-Jazeera journalists and their sensitive sources. Because it is completely customisable, however, there is a risk that the security of the system can be compromised by poor development practices. We are often called in to audit and/or rescue projects in which inexperienced developers have cut corners, and inadvertently created security or performance issues. It is therefore vital that, on a project as sensitive as this, an experienced development team is used — and that a thorough security audit is undertaken before the site goes live.

Our entire staff of over 150 people is EU-based, and this project will be run in the UK with a mainly-UK team.

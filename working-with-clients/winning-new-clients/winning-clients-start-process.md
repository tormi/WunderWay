title: Winning Clients - Start The Process
---

When an opportunity comes to us we follow a clear process to assess it and then work towards a proposal.

## Notify the Sales Manager in the country office
Each country office should have one person who is aware of all the current opportunities. Please let them know about this new one.

## Add the Client and the Opportunity to our CRM
To make sure we keep track of our work properly, and do things at the right time, please start by making sure everything is set up correctly in our CRM system. The project lead should also be responsible for keeping this up to date as the sale progresses.

## Start the documentation
Set up a folder in Google Drive for the client and the project, and set up the folder structure. Upload all the documentation we have there.

## Start a chatroom
In Hipchat start a chatroom for this opportunity, with the naming convention "!Sales: [Name]" where [Name] is the shortname that is to be used for this opportunity.

## Put together a team
We want to put together the right team as early in the process as possible, so that everyone can be part of the Stop/Go decision and the discovery.

We need to have the right people with the right level of availability to undertake our Winning New Clients process. We need:

- A project sponsor: usually someone with long experience at Wunder, and knowledge of the market the client operates in.
- A project leader: someone with enough experience of our Winning New Clients process, who can co-ordinate the team and make key decisions. They will put together the business case. They may have a relevant sector specialism, or have worked on a similar project before.
- A tech lead: someone with expertise in the relevant technologies and challenges involved in the project. They will put together the technical proposal, and lead the estimation.
- A design/UX lead: They will lead the work to make sure the proposal is user-focused, and includes the proper design process to deliver the project.
- An assistant: They will help the team with research, admin, travel arrangements etc. Often this will be the office manager in the local office.

At least one of the project sponsor, project leader, or technical lead should have availability to continue on to deliver the project if we are successful, and on large projects it should be at least two.

If we can't put together a suitable team, with enough availability, then we must say 'Stop' at this point.

## Start the discussion
Invite everyone to the hipchat room, and the google drive folder. Setup a first short meeting to brief everyone on the opportunity and decide an approach. Then set a time for a daily standup meeting. This daily standup is a chance for everyone on the sales team to synchronise each day.

Everyone in the team should 'work out loud' on the sale, discussing everything openly in the hipchat room, rather than 1-1. That way everyone knows the latest.


Once we have the team together and communications in place, we want to make a [Stop/Go Decision](http://way.wunder.io/working-with-clients/winning-new-clients/winning-clients-stop-go/)

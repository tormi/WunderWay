In this section we'll begin to develop our case

## Prepare

Start your plan with the end in mind – imagine that we’ve won the pitch and work backwards to unpick how we did it. We’ll have needed to have completely understood the customer’s wants and needs, and to have looked, sounded and felt different from our competitors.

Customers assume we know our tech stuff and they aren’t generally interested in how the solution actually works. They want it to function, be cheap and make them look good, for reasons that go beyond technological checkboxes.

To get to the bottom of these reasons, we use a Question Tree.

## Reveal Customer Values: The Question Tree
A Question Tree is a tool for capturing the questions a customer needs answered, so they give us a ‘Yes’.

The branches are the big questions, the main motivations the client has – everything they need to feel comfortable with to say ‘Yes’ to us.

The leaves on the branches are the contributory questions feeding those big questions.

### What is a Question Tree for?
A Question Tree forces us use the customer’s needs as a starting point, rather than our capabilities, and helps us uncover the customer’s real motivations for undertaking a project.

It reveals the value propositions and supporting information the client wants from our pitch. It helps us develop our understanding of what they really value, and use that as the basis of the solutions we present. It also shows us the evidence we need to gather so that they trust our response.

The majority of the questions will not be about the technical solution, they’ll be about everything else – the real concerns, queries and motivations behind the client, as a business and as a group of people.

### How do I use a Question Tree?
[TOOL: The Question Tree](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1pXa7WaBZwhqazq4C5_owZJEOKWFdZwnlJyXqMzbFXmY/edit)

#### 1. Start building the tree from the first contact
For example, when we get an email or phone call saying a pitch is coming up, or when we first know we want to target the organization.
The knowledge and information we gather in the Discovery phase will feed the questions we imagine the client posing, and the values that sit behind those questions.

#### 2. Think about the project from the client’s point of view
Not only the client as a company, but also the client as a series of different buyers. (See section: Understanding Our Buyers in Winning Clients - Discovery.)

All of your questions, comments, thoughts and insights must be about *THE* client, not *A* client. This creates a more empathetic pitch, one that isn’t our pitch but is the client’s pitch.

#### 3. Frame the questions as client would
Use their language to focus on the client’s perspective and generate a more far-reaching question.

- It’s not: “What experience does the Wunder team have?”
- It is: “How will the Wunder team get on with mine?”
- This version of the question taps into deeper concerns, certainly about credentials, but also about working approach and team personalities.

Other examples:

- It’s not: “How does the technical solution work?”
- It is: “How easy will it be to achieve what I want with this solution?”
- It’s not: “What is the cost?”
- It is: “Can I justify the cost to my bosses?”

#### 4. If the client won’t talk to us
Build a hypothetical tree from the knowledge we have of similar clients, then combine it with whatever specific information we have been able to gather, to work out what cold pitch should be.

Two-thirds of the content for a successful pitch can probably come from similar pitches we’ve made to similar customers working in similar industries. The other third generally can’t. Consider whether a lack of contact at this stage alters our Stop/Go decision.

#### 5. Group questions under one of four categories

1. Competence – ability to perform as described
2. Affordability – cost, now and in the future; with and without
3. Collaboration – working together as client and provider
4. Gain – for the project, individual, department, company, brand

These categories don’t necessarily translate directly into Question Tree branches, and there may be some overlap, but they help us link concepts and define clearer groups of values.

#### 6. Treat the questions like Agile user-stories.
Discuss the Question Tree as a team to make sure we get to the bottom of ‘Why?’, understand the topics the client really cares about and see them as the client does.

#### 7. Keep validating the questions throughout discussion
This will improve their accuracy and get you nearer to the perfect pitch. Continually ask:

- Is a question in the client’s language?
- Who is the asker? Are they technical or non-technical? Do they have influence?
- What is the question’s context?
- Have we learned anything new about the question?
- Is the question still relevant considering what we’ve learned?
- Which of the four categories does the question come under?
- Is it part of a bigger issue, or feeding smaller issues (leaf or branch)?

### Quick Tips for Creating a Question Tree

- Think like a buyer
- Only include questions
- Forget who you work for – it’s about the client, not us
- No question is too small or too stupid – discount only after considering
- Use Post-It notes on the wall – make the tree visible and flexible
- Keep pushing – the client will have more questions than you might want to answer
- Only move on when the group agrees we’ve captured all questions the client might ask

### Develop the Value Propositions
Each branch we identify in the Question Tree needs a proposition in response. Each leaf is an influence on those individual propositions.

We need to present unique propositions (branch responses) to stand out from our competitors, not write 100 generic pages about why we’re great. We also need to have ready responses for the unprepared part of the pitch (e.g. a casual coffee chat or in the Q&A). Being able to respond well to off-the-cuff questions builds trust.

Propositions should be framed so they convey not just the features of the Wunder service but its benefits as well.

For example:

- “We use Agile on all our projects…” – this is a feature.
- “…to deliver the right product, with a faster time to market, lower risk and a higher return on investment…” – adds the benefits of the feature.
- “For example, we’ve delivered [x] projects on time and on budget, including for [relevant previous client]…”  – adds our uniqueness to the benefits of the feature.

### Tips for Developing Value Propositions

- Develop propositions early – allow time throughout to discuss and test with the client
- Understand business needs and context – research and use your Question Tree
- Understand the buyer’s needs – make it a personal reason to choose Wunder
- Be innovative – show the client you’re thinking about their specific position and have ideas for them
- Refine and test – whenever you have the opportunity, or try to create one

## Prove
Prospective clients won’t just accept we can do what we say in our value propositions – we need to prove it to them. The trick is to prove it in the simplest way, to the right extent, while creating a competitive advantage in buyers’ minds.

After the pitch, we want the buyers to feel:

- inspired and ready to move forward, whether they’re apprehensive or not
- anxious about their status quo, knowing that staying where they are is not an option
- aware of the clear blue water between us and the other competitors
- trusting us as partners who professionals, expert, open and collaborative

We need to get our messages across in a way that’s easy to process and sticks in their minds. Buyers will perhaps remember only a quarter of what they hear in a pitch, and some pieces of information within that quarter will have a disproportionate effect on how they feel.

### Perceived User Value Vs. Perceived Price
The competitive battleground is between perceived value and perceived price – are you seen as expensive or affordable for what you offer?

!(/public/images/WinningClients-PUV1.png)

We need to understand where the customer’s value lies and point out how the product or service we’re showing them corresponds to that.

### Tips to Identify Where Customer Value Lies
Use your Question Tree to ask what the customer might value most when seeking the services of a web consultancy:

- Choose the critical points – the must-haves, not the should haves
- Assign a weighting to each must-have – distribute 100 points between them

### Customer Indifference Curve
Clients aren’t always moved by value – if they’re already on the curve between value and price, they may think that’s enough.

!(/public/images/WinningClients-PUV2.png)

Changing their position (i.e. shifting the curve upwards from blue to purple) will be difficult, but that’s what the pitch is for.

An example of pushing the customer’s indifference curve upwards is Toyota’s creation of the Lexus brand. Toyota picked apart German car engineering and building, and applied Japanese manufacturing to their techniques. This changed the price customers expected to pay for the same value.

### Demonstrating Competitive Advantage
Pitches are not ‘What?’, they are ‘Why?’. Value exists only in the mind of particular consumers. Just because we think something is better doesn’t automatically make it better value for the customer.

We fail in pitches because we tell clients the benefits of our people or technology without proving the value. For example, why should a customer care that we can promise long-term efficiencies in their industry, sector or job? Perhaps because it will benefit their own customers and help them sell more.

The key to proving value and winning pitches is telling stories that elucidate how we translate, adapt and apply the product to our specific buyers.

### Creating Clear Blue Water
Where does it come from and how do we create it? We need to look at our position in our market and prove more value or more return compared to our competitors.

We need to make sure we add the right sort of value for the customer, prove that value, and show how they’ll get more for their money from us than from our competitors.

### Competitive Strategy Options
!(/public/images/WinningClients-PUV1.png)

Looking at the Question Tree, identify where the customer’s value in each question lies. A question like “What’s in it for me?” could mean security of delivery, less hassle from the supplier, or an easier sell internally. Build the pitch around those real meanings of what they value most.

- Ask what they really value?
- What do they think they will get from the value we offer?
- What are they really looking for?
- Think about the customer’s competitors – the real challenges they face in their industry.
- Think about the customer’s customer – their priorities are likely to be your customer’s concerns.

Approaching the pitch from this angle leads to out-of-the-box thinking and solutions, and demonstrates real insight and understanding – exactly what creates clear blue water.

##Three Level of Proof for Value Propositions
How do we prove our value with our responses, especially when the needs and wants they respond to are intangible?

We use proofs to make the client feel their values are being met and they’re making the right decisions. Proofs have three levels, each requiring different amounts depending on their power to convince.

!(/public/images/WinningClients-LevelsOfProof.png)

1. Factual – real information, e.g. improved uptime or conversion stats; quick and easy to prove.
2. Reported – other customers’ testimonials, feedback, case studies; less convincing, so more is needed than with facts.
3. Inferred – examples of different experiences which layer to reflect a particular value; e.g. demonstrating our capacity for innovation by telling separate stories of pioneering development and turning customer teams Agile.

Be ready to give examples in the pitch – factual, reported, inferred – and have more in reserve to support claims we make in response to questions or cross-examination.

Avoid overwhelming the client with information – start with factual proofs since these are the quickest and strongest, then move onto wider proofs if needed.

Find our best proofs by gathering as many as possible from around the Wunder team, then select the strongest. Having lots of examples to hand also proves the depth of our capabilities.

Every pitch will reveal new facts, examples and testimonials. Make sure we capture them and share them with the Wunder team.

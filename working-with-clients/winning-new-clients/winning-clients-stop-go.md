title: Winning Clients - Stop/Go
---

The decision to bid or not to bid is based on two things: our evaluation of the information available and our gut feeling.

We put all new opportunities through the Stop/Go decision gate at numerous points. This is because it is better and cheaper for us to get to 'No' as soon as possible.

# Stop/Go Decision Points

1. As soon as we receive an opportunity.
2. After Sales Discovery.
3. After Plan & Prove work.
4. After Presentation.
5. ...or any other point at which the information or your gut feel changes.

# Making a Stop/Go Decision

The fundamental questions to ask before entering into a pitch process are:

- Do we want it?
- Can we win it?
- Should we win it?

If the answer to either is ‘No’ or even 'Not Sure', our efforts are likely to be better spent on other opportunities.

### Do we want it?
- Is the project itself economically viable?
- Is the client one we want to work with? See [Our Kind of Client](/working-with-clients/finding-new-clients/our-kind-client/)
- Can we put together a good team for the timescale of the project?
- Would we benefit as a company, as a brand, as a team of professionals?
- Would we enjoy the work, and be proud of it?

### Can we win it?
- Can we do what the client needs us to do, really well?
- Do we know people on the client side and have beneficial relationships with them?
- Who are we competing against? Are we able to match and exceed their strengths? How are their relationships with the client?

### Should we win it?
- Would we be the best choice for the client?
- Would we bring something to the project over and above what the general competitors could offer?

## Worksheet
We've developed a new project evaluation worksheet, which lists some of these questions and others, and aims to help us filter all the potential new projects we receive:
[TOOL: New Project Evaluation Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdDZpdWVxQmxLQ2dibkxocUduaTZoRkE#gid=0)
Create a copy of this template worksheet to assess each new project.

The score that comes out of this worksheet doesn't make the decision for you - it's a starter for a conversation between the team. What does it mean that a certain score is showing red? Are there too many reds? Could we deal with those concerns and allow the opportunity to progress?

## Be Highly Selective
Taking part in procurement exercises is a very time consuming, and therefore expensive, process. Therefore we really only want to do it for those that we want to win, can win, and should win. For anything else, or even if we just have doubts, it's best to be honest about it and reject them very early on. It's far better for us, and our clients, if we take part in fewer procurement processes, but with a higher win rate. Beling selective will allow us to focus more time on the ones we should win.

## If It’s ‘Stop’
Remember that the client contact should never end with just ‘NO’. Firstly, we want to provide some value in every contact with other people and organisations. Secondly, there may be other ways to work together in future.

Look at ways to maintain a relationship and develop future opportunities.

- Give the client advice – e.g. to improve their procurement process or technical approach, or to help ensure their project succeeds
- Offer training – invest to show our professionalism and capabilities
- Look to build the relationship – can you get to know them in a social/business setting?
- Keep in touch – stay on their radar and aware of their plans.

## If It’s ‘Go’
It’s time to make plans, starting with [doing a Discovery](http://way.wunder.io/working-with-clients/winning-new-clients/winning-clients-discovery/).

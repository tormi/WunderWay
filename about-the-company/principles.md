To support the character of the company, there are a number of underpinning principles:

## Open By Default
Nothing should be closed and hidden without very good reason. Typical exceptions are indiviudal team members persoal HR records. It's up to them to open up anything in there if they want, not the company.

In most other things it's possible to be way more open than other companies, and it turns out to be a pretty healthy and happy way to be.

One of the ways we build trust with clients (which is key to being able to deliver projects successfully) is complete openness. Sometimes ridiculous openness.

So everything should be open by default unless there's a really good reason otherwise. If it simply makes us uncomfortable to open something up, maybe it's a sign we're doing something wrong and should questions ourselves.


## Self-Managing
We believe that too many layers of managers, doing too much 'managing' slows a company down, and restricts the talents of the people within the company. We want to free people up to do their best work.

Therefore Wunder team members manage themselves, and colaborate together to manage their own projects.

This needs people who are willing to take responsibility, and who enjoy the freedom this brings, so not everyone will fit in our company, but those that do will thrive more than they could anywhere else.

We still need some company management, but we keep this as light as possible.

This also means we're exploring other routes for career development, as we feel that the tradiational route of having to get promoted 'up to management' takes people away from what they are great at and loves doing most. So instead we seek to allow people to develop their careers by becoming deeper specialists in their discipline. This is a work in progress.


## Peer Review
In line with the Self-Managing principle, we don't have managers to review people's work. But sometimes it's valuable to review work.

Instead, we have a policy of peer review. On projects, this can be design reviews, code reviews and so on. In daily work it can be reviews of proposal documents, key emails, or anything else.

It can also be simply checking decisions you are about to make - for example to spend money, turn down some work, hire somebody, and so on. If two people in the company genuinely think something is or isn't the right thing to do, they're probably right.

You can ask anyone in the company to peer review something for you.

Being asked by a colleague to review something for them is an honour as it shows they respect your expertise and your judgement, and think you will give them good guidance. Take the time to do reviews professionally and explain your thinking.


## Frank Helpful Honesty
In line with our open, transparent approach, we also need to be really frank and honest in a helpful and constructive way. This means facing up to problems and disagreements and talking them over as grown ups. It means being prepared to listen to this kind of frankness too.

The same applies with our clients, partners and suppliers. It can take clients a bit of time to get used to, but they end up loving it.


## Work Out Loud
Communication is really important to the open and collaborative way we work. Therefore it's good not to work in quiet isolation all the time (though we all need to sometimes).

We have a number of official communication channels we use, such as hangouts, email, hipchat, in person meetings and pubs. Use these, or anything else that works for you and your colleagues.

Keep your colleagues constantly up to date with your thinking, what you're working on, what problems you face, what's frustrating you, and everything else.

If people are busy they can catch up later, or simply ignore the messages if they're not important, but you'll find people are generally really pleased to hear from you.


## Continuous Improvement
We can always improve, in anything we do. We should actively look for ways to improve, we should seek feedback widely. We'll see to learn and develop as individuals and as a company.

We'll keep improving the tools and processes that support our work. We'll keep improving our work, and the way we work.


## Flexibility
Because we work in an Agile way, and a self managing way, we're more focused on outcomes — **what** gets achieved - rather than where or when work gets done.

This means that, as long as you work effectively with the rest of your team, and the outcomes are good, you can generally work when you like where you like.

There are some meetings you'll have to attend for the smooth operation of the team and delivery of the project, especially at the start and end of each sprint - but you'll agree these as a team on your project.


## Family First
We're lucky enough to work in an industry that is challenging, interesting and fun, and in a company that gives us a lot of freedom. It can be easy to get so wrapped up in our work that we do a bit too much of it.

It's worth remembering the reason we work is not the work itself, but to enable us to support our families (with family used in its broadest sense to just mean those we care about).

That means that sometimes in work time we actually need to prioritise our family, due to sickness, or fun things such as school plays. This sort of thing is more important than work, so arrange with your teammates to be able to fit work around them.

Of course, it's always a case of balance, but you can take a sensible approach to this, and if in doubt, ask a colleague for a peer review!


## Respect and look after each other
This is a catch-all principle to cover everything else. As long as we respect each other, and look after each other, we'll generally be okay.

Respect matters in the way you speak to colleagues, or about them, and the way you collaborate.

Look out for colleagues who have a lot on their plate, those who aren't taking enough holiday, those who have difficult work to deal with, and anything else. We don't have a big management and HR structure, so that means we need to look out for each other as friends and colleagues.

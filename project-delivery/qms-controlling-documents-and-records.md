Controlling documents and records is the way that we maintain our process documents, how and where we archive and ensuring that everyone is using the most current version.

##QMS Change Requests

Changing any part of the QMS effectively changes how we operate as a business. It's important that we continue to evolve and adapt in order to improve but the changes need to be managed carefully. We manage all change requests and implementations via Rally.

If you'd like to request a change then please create a user story and add it to the [Wunderroot > QMS backlog](https://rally1.rallydev.com/#/18084711157d/backlog). Try to be as descriptive as possible.

Changes raised here will be reviewed periodically. If your request is urgent please speak to one of the Steve's.

The QMS change requests process:

<ul>
	<li>Review and prioritise the changes requests once per week</li>
	<li>Review each change request with suitably experienced staff to identify:
	<ul>
		<li>The necessity of the change (if this was the result of a non-conformity does it require a process change, a document change or training)</li>
		<li>The priority of the change</li>
		<li>The impact of the change (disruption, training)</li>
		<li>The value delivered by the change</li>
		<li>New documentation required</li>
		<li>Changes required to the Management Reviews and Internal Audits</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Advise the requester of the outcome by email</li>
	<li>Agree a plan for implementation
	<ul>
		<li>Responsibility</li>
		<li>Date for implementation</li>
		<li>Notify affected staff of the changes ahead of the implementation date</li>
		<li>Requirements for testing (if applicable)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Carry out the implementation</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Documents updated</li>
		<li>Document versions updated and archived</li>
		<li>Cross reference the change request ID with supporting documentation (where applicable)</li>
		<li>Change request log updated to record the changes</li>
		<li>If amending the QMS, add a summary of what is included in the latest version</li>
		<li>Email to staff to advise that the changes are live</li>
	</ul>
	<li>During the weekly review ensure that changes that have been implemented are recorded in the log</li>
</ul>

The effectiveness and operational impact will be reviewed during the Management Reviews and Internal Audits.

All notes relating to the decisions made will be recorded in the <a href="https://rally1.rallydev.com/#/18084711157d/backlog">QMS Change Request Log</a>.

## Control of Documents

### Project Document Templates

The documents referred to within this document are based on templates. All project document templates are stored in Google Drive under:

<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgZXBLTWJSZHZDU3M">WunderRoot Client Projects > ! Repository Template</a>

This repository template and all the documents within it will be copied at the start of every client project. It contains all of the **up to date versions of each document together with a recognised project document structure**.

### General Document Templates

General document templates are stored in Google Drive under:

<a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgd1Q5aHpWS0hQRFU">WunderRoot > WunderRoot QMS</a>

### Managing Document Templates

Changes to document templates is a change to the QMS. Any changes must first be raised in the QMS Change Request Backlog and approved before being implemented.

When amending a template:

<ol>
	<li>Make a copy of the most recent version of the template.</li>
	<li>Amend the title of the document to include the latest version number.</li>
	<li>Move the version being replaced into the Archive sub-folder within that folder.</li>
	<li>Update the QMS Change Request Log to show the date of implementation, the version number and to record any notes necessary.</li>
</ol>

## Control of Records

### Project Records

All project records will be stored in the client project folder that is located at <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgTXRkV0FoYndDMWs">WunderRoot Client Projects</a>.

The structure of the client document repository is a direct copy of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgZXBLTWJSZHZDU3M">Repository TEMPLATE folder</a>. 

All document names will remain the same as the template, including the version but dates in the filename (where applicable) will follow the format provided. Dates generally apply to meeting notes.

All ad-hoc project documents (e.g. technical documentation) should be given a readable name where possible and added to the relevant project folder.

The folder storing the project documentation will be made available to all of those included in the project to promote transparency and openness. 

If any changes are required to documents used for projects they must follow the Quality Management Change Request Procedure (see top of this page).

Sprint sign-off documents are issued and signed digitally using <a href="https://eu1.docusign.net/Member/Home.aspx">DocuSign</a>. A copy of the document is stored in the project repository under Reviews & Assessments > Signed.

Project contracts are issued and signed digitally using <a href="https://eu1.docusign.net/Member/Home.aspx">DocuSign</a>. A copy of the signed contract is stored in the project repository under Contracts > Signed.

### Non Project Documents

Document required by the business for managing non-project related matters are referred to in the procedures through this document. Most are maintained within Google Drive - <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgQmh6UkRnNC16ekE">WunderRoot</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/?tab=mo#folders/0Bxb4YZjQwNDgZkdzVWFBbzZVS28">WunderRoot Management</a> folders. Documents relating to procedures should be linked to from within the project and operational processes described in this wiki.

Changes to any of these documents must follow the Quality Management System Change Procedure (see top of this page).

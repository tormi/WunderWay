## Product Backlog

The product backlog lists all of the requirements that the client has specified. The product backlog is owned by them (the Product Owner) and it’s their responsibility (supported by the Scrum Master and the Project Director) to order the backlog in priority order, with those items delivering the most value first.

Items in the backlog are written as User Stories and follow the format:
As a [ user ], I want [ requirement ], so that [ value gained ]

Requirements are written in this way so that everything is focussed on the end user and so that we understand the value of everything that we’re delivering. If a story does not have a value associated with it then it shouldn’t be included in the backlog.

We use <a href="https://rally1.rallydev.com">Rally</a> to manage our backlogs. Each project is provided with it's own Rally instance and members of the project team (Wunderroot and the client) are provided with access.

When the project first reaches this stage the Scrummaster will prepare the Rally account for the team.

## Sprint Planning, Sprint Backlog & Estimation Accuracy

The project is delivered in iterations, referred to as sprints. The length of each sprint is agreed during the project initiation but is generally between 2-4 weeks. 

Before the next (or first) sprint can begin, a senior developer will scout the product backlog, looking at the highest priority user stories. Any ambiguity will be addressed at this point to make the description of each user story very clear. 

The sprint begins with a Sprint Planning session. During the first half of this session (timeboxed to 4 hours) the Product Owner describes the objectives they would like to achieve during the sprint. They then select and discuss each user story selected from the backlog, providing all the necessary information to The Team in order that they can deliver. The Team make initial estimates of the work at this point until such a time that they feel that the sprint is full. The result of this session is the Sprint Backlog. The objectives for the sprint are recorded in the Sprint Review template which is completed at the end of the sprint and sent to the client for digital signature using DocuSign.

During the second half of the planning session (timeboxed to 4 hours) The Team break down each user story contained in the sprint backlog  into smaller stories and estimate each of those. This provides an accurate estimate of the sprint, enables them to further question the requirements to build up an accurate picture of what will be delivered. Unless the team agree they can accept more into the sprint then the planning session is closed and the development begins.

In order to determine the accuracy of our estimates and to help us determine the amount of work that can be produced during a sprint we capture the estimates and actuals in the sprint backlog. This data is reviewed during the sprint planning session in order to achieve the most accurate estimates and to set client expectations.

## Daily Standup/Scrum

Every day there is a daily call or meeting (timeboxed to 15 minutes) during which time each member of The Team discusses:

“Yesterday I...”
“Today I will...”
“My blockers are...”

This is an opportunity to report progress, report what is planned and to raise any issues.

title: About the WunderWay
---

The WunderWay is our intranet. It sets out the ways in which we work — the way we run the business, the way we deliver our projects, and the way we carry out our day to day work.

Wunder achieved ISO9001 Quality Management certification in 2013. The WunderWay is our Quality Management System in disguise. What this means is that we've set ourselves some clear quality objectives and it's these objectives that shapes the way we do everything described in this WunderWay. To find out the real reasons behind putting the WunderWay together why not spend a moment getting to know our [quality objectives](/working-at-wunderkraut/quality-management/quality-objectives/) and our [quality scope](http://way.wunder.io/working-at-wunderkraut/quality-management/quality-policy/).

title: The WunderExperts Groups
---

The maintenance of the WunderWay is slowly being moved over to expert groups which will be responsible for content that falls under their skills and expertise.

The groups will meet regularly to share experiences, discuss the ways we work, the tools we use and suggestions for improvement. Any suggestions for improvement will be raised as issues or pull requests in the usual way. See [How to edit the WunderWay](/about-this-site/how-edit-wunderway/)

If you have a specific question or idea you'd like to discuss or share then you can talk it through with a member of the group in your country.

If you'd like to be involved with a group or want to create a new group then raise an issue.

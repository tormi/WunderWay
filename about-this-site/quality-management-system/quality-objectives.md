title: Our Quality Objectives
---

Effective from:
October 2012

**Responsibility:**

- Steve Parks, Managing Director
- Steve Hunton, Projects & Operations Manager

**Introduction:**

The quality objectives that we define for ourselves are what underpin our Quality Management System.

The Quality Objectives are derived from the overall [WR Business Objectives](/about-the-company/business-objectives/).

- [Quality Policy & Scope](working-at-wunderkraut/quality-management/quality-policy/)

##Professional Services##

Our primary objective is to provide professional services to our customers. In order to do this we need to focus on several sub-objectives:

**Development and Provision of Quality Products**

Goals & Measurements:

- 100% sign-off of sprints at first attempt
- 80% accuracy in sprint estimates
- Maximum of 4 major product non-conformities in client testing

The quality of the products that we produce must be consistently high and must be fit for the purpose for which they are intended. The quality of our products must be reviewed regularly by ourselves and our customers and suggested improvements must be easily recorded, reviewed and implemented where necessary.

We must maintain quality in everything that we do including the service we provide and the products we build.

*The quality of the products that we produce will be measured by the satisfaction of the client at the end of each sprint (usability and bug count). Sign-off of a sprint is acceptance of the quality delivered. Sprint estimation accuracy provides a clear indication of what is possible within the remaining sprints and allows for more accurate planning.*

**The Provision of a Quality Service**

Goals & Measurements:

- 100% sign-off of all sprints at first attempt
- 100% sign-off of overall project at first attempt

The quality of the services that we provide must be consistently high, must provide assurances to our customers and must be constantly improved as we learn. The quality of our services must be reviewed regularly by ourselves and our customers and suggested improvements must be easily recorded, reviewed and implemented where necessary.

*The satisfaction of customers is recorded at the end of every sprint and at the end of every project.  Sign-off of a sprint is acceptance of the quality delivered.*

**Managing Risk**

Goals & Measurements:

- The maintenance and management of risk logs for all projects
- The maintenance and management of a risk log for the business
- Regular reporting of risks in steering group meetings

Risk is inherent in everything that we do. We must seek to identify and manage risks throughout all our business. Managing risk, and showing that we’re managing risk provides assurances to our customers and staff that we’re in control and are prepared. Risks are identified within projects and must be reviewed regularly in order to mitigate and manage the likelihood of them occurring.

*The management of risk provides assurances to the customer of a quality service. The quality of the service is addressed with the customer at the end of every sprint and project. Risk cannot be avoided. By providing a means to capture risks and assigning an owner to the management of the risk logs with regular reviews we can carefully monitor the progress of mitigation against each risk.*

**Efficient Operations**

The operation on our business must be as efficient as possible in order to enjoy bigger margins and to be competitive in our pricing.

Effective operations includes:

- Maintaining well trained, skilled and happy staff
- Reviewing the cost of seeking and winning business
- Reviewing our processes to identify and implement improvements
- Communicating regularly to discuss and manage individual needs, project needs and business needs and providing the means to communicate and record suggestions for improvement
- The management of non-conformities and preventive actions
- Continuous QMS reviews and improvement

The efficiency of our operations will be measured by:

- Implementing a skills matrix and training plan that meets the needs of the business
- Reviewing new business acquisition regularly, identifying and implementing efficiency
- The upkeep of the QMS Change Request backlog
- Bug tracking
- Regular, planned internal audits and management reviews

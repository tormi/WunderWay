title: How To Buy A Computer
---

Everyone in the company gets an equipment budget every two years. You can spend this as you like, saving it up to get cooler, more expensive devices less frequently, or replacing cheaper devices on a regular basis.
It can be used for home office equipment, laptops, mobile phones, tablets or any other equipment which

If in doubt about whether something you want to buy fits within your budget, ask any colleague for a peer review.

## Ordering Apple equipment

Macbooks Pros/Airs are the most popular laptops in the company. They're not required (you can choose any computer), but you'll find it a lot easier to colaborate with colleagues and use the same tools and resources.

We have a special account with Apple called 'Joint Venture'. This gives us a discount, and special arrangements on repairs, replacements and support.

Unfortunately they are not geared up to provide this through the Apple Store online, so you have to contact the Business Team in any physical Apple Store in the UK to arrange your order. They can do this over the phone/email.

The main store contacts we use are:

- Email: coventgardenbusiness@apple.com
- Tel: 0207 447 1420

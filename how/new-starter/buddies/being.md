Being a buddy is an important role, but it's not a weighty task, and you're not alone. You'll help to make this a welcoming place to work, but you don't have to know everything about working here - just where to go to find out more.

##Before your new starter arrives

In the week or two running up to the new person arriving, a few things need to be prepared. The first week at a new workplace is obviously very significant for setting the mood of life at WunderRoot, and it's important to have a good plan for the first week or two.

Make sure you clear time in your own project diary so that you can be free and available to spend as much time as is necessary to help the new starter feel at home.

###Making a plan

The new starter will probably be assigned a mentor for their new role. You'll want to arrange a good period of time with the mentor to write a plan for the new starter's first week. Make sure you also talk to team or project staff that the new person will be working closely with – they're sure to have lots of thoughts on what they would like their new colleague to be getting to grips with in those first few days.

In particular, you need to schedule in time for:

- basic welcomes and introductions to WunderRoot, and the wider WunderKraut body;
- getting set up on communication systems, especially email, phone and chat tools;
- introductions to projects that the new starter will be working on, and the colleagues they'll be working most closely with;
- access to projects and documentation that they'll need for their work;
- an overview of the week-to-week rhythm of work;
- Fridays!

There's more on all of these below.

##The first day

We appreciate face-to-face contact on someone's first day, so prior to the new starter arriving make sure you arrange to meet up in person on that first day.

You can meet up wherever you'd like to, but a good option is our office space in [The Hub, in Kings Cross, London](http://kingscross.impacthub.net/). If you don't know how to make use of the space at The Hub, contact Steve Hunton.

###'Welcome to WunderRoot!'

On the first day, it's important to send the new starter a 'Welcome to WunderRoot!' email.

We have a [template for the email](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/document/d/12XhM_C_U5hXfCP_UjhxJQCv8v-LhR0pOMPEQJIXQHCA/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use, but you should tailor it to the particular circumstances of the new starter. You should know all about this from your discussions with the mentor and any teammates of the new person.

###Who are we?

The first day should include time to meet with either the newbie's mentor, or with Steve Parks, or both, to find out essentials of WunderRoot and WunderKraut - who we are, what we do, how we do it and why we do it this way.

This might be in person, or virtually in a hangout. If Steve's involved, it'll include a beer. Or two.

Do spend some time talking about the week-to-week rhythm of work at WunderRoot, with things like daily stand-ups, making the most of our chat tools, working in a distributed business, and especially talking about Fridays.

It's also important to spend time on the first day to get the new starter set up with our communication tools:

- **email**;
  - including getting set up on their favoured email client
- **phone**;
  - (the [SIP phones](/how/sip-phone-setup/) can sometimes be tricky to set up)
  - intro to the [phone directory](/who/wr-phone-directory/)
- **chat tools**;
  - key channels are the WunderCafe, WunderRoot, and the Questions
  - include an introduction to Cato, our robot butler
- **Google Drive**;
  - give an overview of how to find your way around, if you've managed to fathom it out!

###Who are you?

In order to get to know each other you should aim to write a short biography of the new person on their first day. This should be added to the [Staff Directory page of WunderWay](/who/).

###What's gonna be happening this week?

Spend time to go over the plan for this week, and maybe set up some meetings for the new starter and their teammates or project leaders to get introduced to the projects and clients.

If there's time to get connected to code repositories or documentation before the day is out, then make a start on that.

###Fancy a pint?

It's always good to finish the day at beer o'clock.

##The second day

If you're not together in person on the second day too, make sure you start the day with a Hangout.

You might like to have at least one more at some other point during the day too, maybe at the end. It's vital to keep talking regularly though the first week.

The second day is time to get connected to projects and project work. You may need to get the newbie added into code repositories (or ask someone to do it for you), and show them where they can find the documentation they'll need for their day-to-day work.

They may then want time to get their laptop set up with a working development environment for their key projects, and to spend time with the lead developer or other people on their projects.

##The rest of the week

Don't forget to have at least one Hangout each day - first thing is probably a good idea, and you may like to catch up at the end of the day too.

Remember to recap the plan for the week, and ask about how things have been going.

It's also really important regularly to check the Questions channel in HipChat - any questions in there should have a response as soon as you're able. Any questions asked in the Questions channel may be useful enough to add an item to the [New Starter Questions here on WunderWay](how/new-starter/questions/) - if so, either add a page to the site, or create an issue (in Rally? as a GitHub repo issue?) to add one. It's your responsibility to make sure this questions gets added to the site!

###The first Friday

Make sure you introduce the new starter on their first Friday company Hangout, and get them to talk about what they've been doing this week, and what they're going to be working on at WunderRoot.

##The next few weeks

You'll need to carry on the same sort of rhythm:

- make sure you have Hangouts regularly;
- keep checking the

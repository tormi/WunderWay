title: What happens at my six-month review?
---

After you've been at WunderRoot for your first six months, you'll have a progress review.

This is a pretty straightforward thing. You'll meet with either Steve Parks or Steve Hunton, probably, and have a chance to talk about various aspects of your first six months:

- your successes;
- your challenges;
- how you've settled into your role;
- how you're getting on with colleagues;
- how you're finding the projects your work on and clients your work for;
- how you're getting on with the distributed working thing;
- plans for the next six months;
- about your equipment and other practical support stuff;
- anything that's on your mind;
- etc.

After that, you should receive a written review. This will be completed by at least two people, probably your mentor and the Managing Director, Steve Parks, but it might also include comments by others as appropriate to your role and projects.

The written review will include things like a summary of your review meeting, an overview from your two (or more) reviewers, and number of points for action.

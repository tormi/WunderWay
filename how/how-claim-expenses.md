title: How To Claim Expenses
---


## Policy
You can reclaim any reasonable expense that you incur in the course of doing your job. Please spend the money as if it's your own, because the financial health of the company is the responsibility of all of us.
If in doubt about whether any expense is reasonable to incur, please discuss it with any colleague as a peer review.

## Claiming Expenses
To claim an expense, simply send a photo of the VAT receipt to uk.finance@wunderroot.co.uk explaining what it is for. Please also mention if it relates to any particular project you are working on.

## Business Credit Cards
Some team members have company credit cards. We're working on getting these for all staff who have to travel regularly.

We still need copies of the receipts of things you pay for with your company card, so please keep the receipts. To file them, send a photo of the receipt to uk.finance@wunderroot.co.uk specifying that you paid with your company card.

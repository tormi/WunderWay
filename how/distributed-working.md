title: Working In A Distributed Way
---

At Wundercamp London in August 2014 we held a session to look at the way we work on projects where team members are drawn from multiple countries (most of our projects). These are some of the notes we came up with:


- Frequent calls, hangouts, etc
- Celebrate, mark milestones together
- Get face to face as often as possible
- Decent flights, hotels, food etc when meeting up. Don't be exhausted for the project day as a result of skimping on flying in the night before and taking a cheap early flight.
- Adapt working hours to accomodate a project timezone
- Visualise working times of team members to know who is around when, and sign in and out with colleagues even just by saying hi and bye in chats
- Understand cultural differences, and work to bridge them
- Make sure there is reliable connectivity where you are, and have a plan B (4G dongle)
- Experiment and constantly improve the way we work across countries


Additionally, we can do more to understand the different national cultures:

- A booklet, or WunderWay page, about the culture in each country
- Wundertalks on the different cultures


Our notes from the session are:

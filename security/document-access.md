To provide comprehensive information for the staff, contractors and customers of Wunderroot regarding the storage of Wunderroot documents and outlines which of these are accessible to the public and internally.
This document forms part of Wunderroot’s ISO 27001 Information Security Management System.

###Responsibilities

This document is for staff, contractors and customers of wunderoot.

###Wunderroot documents in Google drive

Wunderroot project documents are collaborative between different members of the company and are shared on google drive.
This includes:

*	Project information
*	Briefs
*	Scopes


This information is stored across many data centres owned by google, these are across Europe and the US which prevents any undue loss of data and is protected against fire and server failure. Google documents however cannot be backed up automatically and require manual download at intervals to make sure that all company information remains backed up.

Information stored on google is protected by their ISO 27001 accreditation. Google Drive includes dozens of critical security features specifically designed to keep data safe and secure. These include encryption in transit as data moves from mobile devices to Google, as it moves between Google's data centers and when it is stored on any mobile device. 


###Classifying and naming Wunderroot documents

All documents should be filed with naming conventions that follow those that have already been defined in the google drive.
Personnel HR information however is not available internally along with any other confidential material.

All of Wunderroot’s documents should carry a classification clearly marked on every page defining to whom it can be distributed to.
The classification options are

*	Public
*	Internal
*	Confidential


###Confidential documents

Confidential documents should be marked with the word “confidential” on every page to ensure that it is a recognisable as a non distributable document. Confidential documents should not be printed or photocopied unless prior authorisation has been agreed. If a confidential document is printed or photocopied the disposal of all duplicates should be done in a secure fashion through means of secure shredding or incineration.
Internal documents

Wunderroot share their documents internally to the Wunderkraut group using google drive as a collaborative repository to allow staff involved in each project a good project overview and ability to update the documents whenever required. This prevents documents becoming outdated or duplicated.
Public documents

Information regarding Wunderroot that is pubilcally available is contained within [the Wunderway](http://way.wunder.co.uk) this is a website containing information about wunderroot, their practises, project management theories and also other helpful information. Any public documents should undergo peer review before they are published to minimise any incorrect information being released. 

Customer information is not shared on Wunderway. 


###Housekeeping

Google Docs works on a document sharing system, if documents are deleted from any one account that are being shared with others, the document will be deleted from all accounts. This means that files should only be deleted when it is clear that the document is not being used or is required by other collaborators. 

###When an employee with a google account leaves Wunderroot

Before the user account is removed from google, the contents of the google docs for that individual must be transferred to another current user to remain accessible within the system
to do this :
Sign in to the Google Admin console.
 
Click Google Apps > Drive. Where is it?
Click Transfer ownership.

Complete the Document ownership transfer section:
In the From field, enter the user name of the current owner and select the user’s domain.
In the To field, enter the user name of the new owner and select the user’s domain.
Tip: If the transfer involves a very large number of documents, you may want to notify the new owner and check that they have enough storage capacity to accommodate the transferred documents. (You can see the amount of storage used and available at the bottom left corner of Google Drive on the web.)

Click Transfer documents to save.

All of the transferred documents are automatically organized in a single new folder — titled with the previous owner’s email address — in the new owner’s Drive.

The administrator and the new and previous owners receive email about the transfer as soon as the process completes.

If there were any problems with the transfer (e.g. the new owner's quota is exceeded, which prevents the transfer of some documents), the email notification describes what happened. To fix the problem, you might purchase more storage for Google Drive for the new owner, transfer ownership of the documents to a different user, or redistribute ownership of documents one at a time to different users.

If you intend to delete the original owner of the transferred files, make sure to wait until the transfer finishes

###Git Hub

When added to the respositoroes the used can edit, clone, branch code with every change being version controlled and trackable. This prevents any loss of code or irreversible errors.

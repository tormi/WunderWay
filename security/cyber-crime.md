It is the responsibility of Wunderroot, to implement procedures to effectively manage and provide necessary protection of Wunderroot from cyber attacks.
The purpose of this policy is to set out the criteria for the prevention of cyber crime and guidelines to dealing with a threat.
This document forms part of Wunderroot’s ISO 27001 Information Security Management System.

This policy is applicable to all staff, contractors and volunteers working within Wunderroot.

##Responsibility##
###Users###
All wunderroot staff and contractors are required to take responsibility for the prevention and detection of cyber crime. If a vulnerability or attack is noticed, all staff should follow the guidelines below to notify the correct people and undertake steps to prevent any loss of data.
Access points to the Wunderroot servers

All users are required to SSH into client servers using a secure connection through a VPN, Wunderroot does not have an internal network however all user laptops are controlled using the policy outlined in the Wunderroot Laptop policy which protects them against violation if lost, stolen, left alone or damaged. 

Using a VPN encrypts and information being processed and protects against any violations through public wifi or other open network connections

All sites created by Wunderroot are created using SSL certificates by default.

###Denial of Service Attacks###

Using SPDY an open networking protocol developed primarily at Google which transports web content. SPDY manipulates HTTP traffic, with particular goals of reducing web page load latency and improving web security. SPDY achieves reduced latency through compression, multiplexing, and prioritization. This prevents Denial of service attacks as SPDY can overcome huge volumes of server requests meaning sites will stay active even under attack.

###Guarding against brute force attacks###

Wunderroot use penetration testing to identify weaknesses and access points that may provide a vulnerability in any sites produced. This allows Wunderroot to detect any issues that may be found before the website goes live and therefore reducing the risk of brute force attacks and secure the website environment. 

In addition to penetration testing passwordless access to SSH can be used to stop any unauthorized attacks on the servers, removes the use of typed passwords to access SSH and implements the use of public keys. Wunderroot if required can also revoke access to the root user of the site which will prevent anyone having complete administrative control over the site.

###Hardware###

All hardware used by wunderroot staff is purchased from Apple suppliers and is not jailbroken or modified in anyway. Wunderroot ensures that all Laptop hard drives and phones are encrypted, whether iOS or Android. 
Please refer to the [Wunderroot laptop policy](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/document/d/1UBOFlipb89nTbO03MzPi9MOqRTNEpB_-WMH_YwqiPI8/edit?usp=sharing).

###Password protection###

All manufacturer supplied passwords must be changed immediately when a product is installed or purchased to defend against any attempts at hacking.

Wunderroot require all users to use Last Pass, One pass or another similar product to generate and store personal passwords for logins that are 16+ characters and contain both alphanumeric characters and punctuation. Using a password vault will mean any saved passwords are encrypted and the production of subsequent passwords will be random and not memorable. 

No passwords are to be transferred in emails or via hipchat and should be sent in a secure way to prevent any unauthorised access to secure areas. 

###Risk###

Wunderroot is Agile, which means that the planning and work is completed in sprints, throughout these iterations risk is calculated accordingly during the lifetime of the project.

Assessment of data its application, where it has been used and security threats can be done frequently. Wunderroot will exercise a professional level of judgement on any threat sources which can be identified early on along with the business impact implications and risk levels. Prioritising and eradicating these can easily be added into the project without effect on the release date or cost.

Any major source of threat identified (particularly the major threat sources relating to national security) will be passed to the relevant sources of authority to evaluate and advise on.
                
Wunderroot will use the IS1 Risk evaluation criteria to identify risk arising during any government projects [IS1 Risk documentation](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cesg.gov.uk%2Fpublications%2Fdocuments%2Fis1_risk_assessment.pdf&ei=8vZgVPbQE87Q7AaLwYCACQ&usg=AFQjCNEt775STBvVSfwJX1tQFwfnTEd4Rw&sig2=AfCvKcUukWZdo3SguOR39g&bvm=bv.79189006,d.ZGU)

title: Professional Development Plan
---

We recognise the importance of helping our staff to develop and grow professionally. After all, the more experienced and skilled you are the better it is for us. 

When you've been with us for 6 months we'll talk with you about putting in place a plan for your own personal development. The personal development plan takes a look at your existing skills and looks at where you would like to be in the next 1-3 years. Armed with that information we can formulate a plan to help you achieve your professional goals.

Achieving your goals will be a mixture of involving you in particular projects to give you more experience of a particular skill or exposing you to particular types of project. Your plan might include external training events in which case we're help organise these for you.

If you receive any direct training then we'll ask you to provide a review of how effective it was for you and whether you'd recommend it to others. Training is often costly so it's important to check the value we're getting from that. If there is enough value then it may be worth the investment in others.

Every six months we'll review the progress you've made to make sure you're on track. If something changes in the meantime or we discover you're not on track then that's the opportunity to fix it.

You can view an example of the Personal Development Plan template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZLU_bK3Y6C0i1vrulNmWiOFqtC03AM4a4zV0wpF_Mp8/edit).

Process:

 - The Operations Manager invites you to a meeting to review your personal plan
 - Together you record the progress you've made towards the objectives set
 - You review the objectives, check that they're current and amend if not
 - The older review document should be renamed, including the date of the review in the filename and stored in the same folder so that we maintain a record

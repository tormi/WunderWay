title: Professional Development Plan
---

We recognise the importantce of helping our staff to develop and grow professionally. After all, the more experienced and skilled you are the better it is for us. 

When you've been with us for 6 months we'll talk with you about putting in place a plan for your own personal development. The personal development plan takes a look at your existing skills and looks at where you would like to be in the next 1-3 years. Armed with that information we can formulate a plan to help you achieve your professional goals.

Achieving your goals will be a mixture of involving you in particular projects to give you more experience of a particular skill or exposing you to particular types of project. Your plan might include external training events in which case we're help organise these for you.

Every six months we'll review the progress you've made to make sure you're on track. If something changes in the meantime or we discover you're not on track then that's the opportunity to fix it.

You can view an example of the Personal Development Plan template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZLU_bK3Y6C0i1vrulNmWiOFqtC03AM4a4zV0wpF_Mp8/edit).

title: Pyramid of Communication
---
We have plenty of channels, how to communicate with peers and customers. The _Pyramid of Communication_ provides a guideline, when to use which channel based on the urgency of the topic to address.

This list is ordered descendingly from urgent & synchronous to informative & asynchronous:

1. Face-to-face 
2. Traditional Voice [Mobile / Landline]
3. Skype / “VOIP” 
4. Directed Chat (1:1, small group chat)
5. Groupchat 
	* Directed @someone
	* Directed @all / @here
6. EMail 

## Synchron vs. Asynchron
There are multiple dimensions to consider, whether to choose a synchronous or an asynchronous channel of communication:

### Availability
Is the other person available right now or within a suitable time slot?
**TODO**

### Documentation
Do I need written approval of something? Do I want to document the issue at hand?
**TODO**

### Urgency
Do I need feedback now? 
The more time critical my request is, the more synchronous needs to be the channel of communication.
**TODO**

### Actionable
Is what I want actionable without further explanation or is it explorative and will require some clarifications?
**TODO**

### Privacy
Do I need to communicate something intagible, sensitive, explorative, group dynamics, important etc.?
**TODO**

## Pyramid of Communication
We have plenty of channels, how to communicate with peers and customers. The _Pyramid of Communication_ provides a guideline, when to use which channel based on the urgency of the topic to address.

This list is ordered descendingly from urgent & synchronous to informative & asynchronous:

1. Face-to-face 
2. Traditional Voice [Mobile / Landline]
3. Skype / “VOIP” 
4. Directed Chat (1:1, small group chat)
5. Groupchat 
	* Directed @someone
	* Directed @all / @here
6. EMail 

### Synchron vs. Asynchron
There are three dimensions fo decide, whether to choose a synchronous or an asynchronous channel of communication:

#### Urgency
Do I need feedback now? 
The more time critical my request is, the more synchronous needs to be the channel of communication.

#### Focus
Is what I want actionable / explorative?
**TODO**

#### Empathy
Do I need to communicate something intagible, sensitive, explorative, group dynamics, important etc.?
**TODO**

## Commitment

* If I address a person, I will expect an answer.
* If I’ve asked for something, I confirm that I’ve read the answer and confirm that this helped/resolved my issue.
* If I’ve asked for something and things/circumstances change, I will send a notfication ASAP.

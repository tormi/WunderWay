title: Pyramid of Communication

## Choose your channel appropriately
The choice of which communication channel is most appropriate depends on the purpose of the conversation, as well as on the surrounding conditions.

We have plenty of channels, how to communicate with peers and customers. The _Pyramid of Communication_ provides a guideline, when to use which channel based on the urgency of the topic to address.

This list is ordered descendingly from urgent & synchronous to informative & asynchronous:

1. Face-to-face 
2. Traditional Voice Call (Mobile / Landline)
3. Video Call: Skype / “VOIP” 
4. Directed Chat (1:1, small group chat)
5. Groupchat 
	* Directed @someone
	* Directed @all / @here
6. Issue, Ticketing or Project Management Application
7. Email 

### Types of conversations/purpose and the communication channels
Typical types and purposes of conversations, and their appropriate channel:

1. Informing:
2. Updating: Updates on tasks and status updates on them
3. Escalating:
4. Exploring:
5. Inspiring:
6. Advising: providing feedback
7. Chatting

#### When should I lean towards asynchronous communication?
* Informing: e.g. email
* Updating: e.g. ticketing system
* Chatting

#### When should I lean towards synchronous communication?
* Escalating: at least by call, supported by email for documenation purposes
* Exploring: e.g. video call, workshop, face-to-face
* Inspiring: e.g. video call, face-to-face
* Advising: e.g. video call, face-to-face
* Chatting

### Surrounding conditions
In addition to the type or purpose of a conversation, there are multiple aspects to consider, whether to choose a synchronous or an asynchronous channel of communication:

#### Urgency
Question: do I need the other person act right now?

#### Availability
Question: is the other person available right now, within a suitable time slot and do I want to interrupt the person's workflow?

#### Documentation / Persistence
Question: do I need written approval of something? Do I want to document the issue at hand?

#### Actionable
Question: is what I want actionable without further explanation or is it explorative and will require some clarifications?

#### Privacy
Question: do I need to communicate something intagible, delicate, sensitive, group dynamics, personal important etc.?

## We are remote, we are documented
Keep always in mind that Wunderkraut is operating in a highly remote setup. This implies that your peers and you will benefit from well documented and accessible communication.

Thus, regardless of the communication channel: document, document, document - or along the line of scientist: publish or perish!

To improve the security and protect confidentiality of information, Wunderkraut employees should adopt a clear desk policy for papers and removable storage media and clear screen policy for information processing facilities.

This is to reduce the risk of unauthorised access, loss of, and damage to information during and outside normal working hours or when areas are left unattended.

This document forms part of Wunderkraut’s ISO 27001 Information Security Management System.

## Responsibility
All staff must take personal responsibility for the security of the data in their care.
Management are responsible for ensuring that their staff clearly understand and adhere to this policy.

### Clear Desk Policy

Wunderkraut recognises that any documents or material left out (e.g. on a desk, printer or cupboard to) is more susceptible to damage, disclosure or theft, particularly outside of office hours.

Where appropriate, paper and computer media must be stored out of sight in cabinets and/or furniture when not in use, especially outside working hours.

Sensitive or critical business information should be securely stored online.

All removable data storage and computing devices (e.g. USB sticks, diskettes, handhelds, etc) which contain confidential or sensitive data must be stored in a secure location when not in use.

### Clear Screen Policy

Wunderkraut recognises there is a risk to unauthorised access to systems should computers remain unlocked. There is also a potential for sensitive data to be viewed if left on screen.

A clear screen policy is in effect on Wunderkraut computer screens (PCs, terminals and laptops).

All laptops should be configured with a password-protected screen-saver. This is activated automatically after a period without user activity of at most 15 minutes.

Personal computers and computer terminals and printers must not be left logged on when unattended and must be protected by key lock, passwords or other controls when not in use.

Effective passwords should not be easy for someone to guess. Names, words, telephone numbers, dates of birth etc., must not be used. Users should use passwords which meet the following minimum password complexity rules: 

  - minimum of 8 characters in length; where possible, the minimum character length will be configured in the system;
  - recommend a change at least every 90 days;
  - contain at least three of the four possible character types, (lowercase letters, upper case letters, numbers and symbols)

Screen Filters should be used on any laptop or device being used in a public environment to avoid unauthorized individuals reading sensitive information

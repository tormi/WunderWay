title: Drupal - An Open Source CMS
---

The Drupal content management system (CMS) has a modular design which allows projects to develop over time in a very flexible, future-proof way. It’s also known for its performance and security, including fine-grained and customisable permissions and workflows within the application.
Governments around the world are already using it for sensitive projects because of its reputation. 

Above all, it has a very user-friendly interface for content creators, editors and managers. It will be easy for non-technical users to make changes to the content on any part of the site at any time.

Drupal is a widely adopted solution within the UK Government. By choosing it you will:

*	benefit from collaboration between departments and agencies
*	draw on experienced suppliers, contractors and staff to avoid vendor lock-in
*	ensure long term supportability and development
*	have a platform that is dynamic and flexible to support future requirements
*	benefit from a wide range of stable, secure contributed modules to quickly and easily add functionality
*	have reassurance from knowing the platform has been approved widely within Government.

The UK Government is a big advocate of Drupal, Agile  and Open Source and they’re realising big savings from these. A recent blog posted on the Cabinet Office [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-save-millions-on-ict] (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-save-millions-on-ict) website talks about saving millions of pounds by switching to Agile delivery methods and Open Standards.

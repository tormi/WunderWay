title: Drupal - Website Search
---

While the website search tool is intended for the front end, it’s important to understand there’s also a connection with the CMS.

We can configure the search engine to index and weight certain content as it’s created, in order to maximise the efficiency of this tool. The individual product types selected during content creation can be integrated into the search engine to maximise the exposure of the products, brands and collections that your customers will be searching for.

Providing a search facility on the site enables your users to find specific content very easily. For a scalable search, capable of returning accurate results very quickly, we suggest Apache Solr - an open-source solution optimised for high-volume web traffic.

Apache Solr is flexible, with an extensible plugin architecture. It can be extended to search within documents such as PDFs, Word and Excel, so it indexes their content to be returned in searches, too. It provides full logging and can report on index statistics and user queries.

The keyword search facility can be extended, giving users the option to complete an advanced search.

It can also be configured so users can save their searches. They can then be notified when new content is available in those categories, or simply use them to quickly find their way back to a section of content.

Search results will be returned and presented to the user in a similar way to Google. Users also get a list of options for ordering the results returned to them. The order options are entirely configurable and can include ordering by:

*	Product name
*	Brand
*	Collection
*	Arrival date
*	Designer name
*	Price
*	Fabric/material
*	Style

These options add to the experience for the user by making the content easier to find and more relevant to them. No two users are the same and we need to add these different ways of surfacing content in order to appeal to as wide a range of users as possible.

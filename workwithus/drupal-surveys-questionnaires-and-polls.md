title: Drupal - Surveys, Questionnaires and Polls
---

Surveys and polls are a great way to interact with your customers and get valuable feedback about their experience on your site or with the fulfillment of their order.

The results of these can provide very good insights for your other customers too, helping them to understand a wider range of experience about a service or product.

When creating polls and questionnaires the CMS provides a number of features to build up your form and responses:

*	Create questions and the answers that users can select from
*	Create different response types such as multiple choice, drop down answers and free text
*	Add checking to the form to ensure that all mandatory questions have been completed correctly

 The author has the opportunity to see how it will be viewed on any device. Once they’re happy with the content and the layout, they’ll mark it for publishing and it will pass through the workflow.

Responses that are submitted are saved in a database. The data from the polls and questionnaires can be accessed via the CMS, for download and review in another tool, or for display in graphical formats on the site.

You can use feedback from your customers to your own advantage. For example, if you’re encouraging more people to complete a transaction on the website rather than visit a shop. You could use the favourable results of a poll on the website to show that ‘99% of people would recommend...’ to provide assurances to other potential customers.

title: Introduction to Project Delivery
---
We use an Agile framework (Scrum) to deliver our projects. While Scrum allows flexibility in order to handle multiple changes throughout the life of the project, our general project processes are rigid. The processes are not overwhelming but are necessary to control the delivery and to achieve our <a href="/company/qms">quality objectives</a>.

**What is Scrum?**

Scrum is an Agile framework. A framework is different to a methodology such as Prince2 or Catalyst in that it does not describe every step in the project delivery process. Instead it describes the key stages we need to go through leaving us to tailor the actual delivery according to our experience.

Agile is different to waterfall delivery in that it's an iterative process. Rather that describing every last requirement before the project begins we're able to describe only the highest priority requirements.

**Product Backlog and User Stories**

When we begin a project with Scrum we define a product backlog with user stories. User stories describe requirements from the point of view of the person that the requirement relates to. Each user story follows the following pattern:

As a [*user*],
I want [*something*],
so that [*value*]

This method ensures that we always know who the user is, what they're expecting (a particular report, images displayed in a certain way, advanced search options) and the value that this delivers. Many traditional project methodologies tend not to focus on the value that requirements deliver. With Scrum we focus on the actual value being delivered and we prioritise these.

The Product Owner (a client role) is responsible for prioritising the backlog but are supported by the Scrum Master.

Backlogs for all our projects are managed in <a href="https://rally1.rallydev.com/#/18084711157d/backlog">Rally</a>.

**Sprints**

We deliver in iterations called *sprints*. Each sprint is usually two weeks long. The sprint begins with a planning session where user stories are selected for the sprint backlog. The team discuss and estimate each of the stories in the backlog and continue to accept more stories until they feel that the sprint is full. At this point the sprint begins.

**Daily Standup**

There is a daily standup meeting where each member of the team discusses their progress from the previous day, what they plan to do today and they raise any issues (blockers) that are preventing them from  continuing with a particular story.

**Sprint Demo and Retrospective**

At the end of the sprint the team demonstrates the result of the sprint to the client. The team then carries out a retrospective to discuss what went well in the sprint, what wasn't so good and what they want to improve in future sprints. This is an opportunity to continually improve the way in which the project is delivered.

For a more detailed look at how projects are delivered, see <a href="/projects/backlogs-and-planning">Delivering a Project</a>.

**Quality Objectives**

As a business we set ourselves quality objectives. The objectives were put in place to challenge us to provide a high level of service. These objectives cover our staff (skills, training, well being) and the quality of the services and products we provide. In order to monitor our progress we capture data at key points in each project. See <a href="/company/qms">Quality Management System (QMS)</a> for more information.

**Scrum Roles**

There are 4 key roles within our Scrum framework:

**Product Owner**

This is a client role and it has the overall responsibility for defining the product.

**Scrum Master**

This role is responsible for the implementation of Scrum. The role also provides coaching to the Product Owner to help guide them through the project and to help them make decisions.

**The Team**

This describes the developers and designers who are responsible for developing the product.

**Project Director**

This is a high-level position that supports the Product Owner and Scrum Master while taking a birds-eye view of the project helping steer the project in the right direction. The position takes responsibility for helping guide the Product Owner and helping them prioritise stories in the product backlog. It’s a role that focuses on business priorities and value. The Project Director also takes some responsibility for aligning the project with the QMS.

Within each step of the project process we need to consider the following elements:
<ul>
	<li>Expertise - this provides quality and assurance to the customer</li>
	<li>Risk Management - risk is everywhere and needs to be managed</li>
	<li>Professionalism - this is where our experience counts</li>
	<li>Quality - our chances to shine and produce something more</li>
	<li>Openness - communication and sharing</li>
	<li>Output - the documentation that we produce</li>
</ul>

Each of these elements plays a role in us achieving our <a href="/company/qms">quality objectives</a>.

title: Monitoring Costs & Managing Efficiency
---

It's important that we capture the costs associated with projects so we can understand where we're spending money and where we can cut costs.

##Cost to pursue and win business

We record the cost to pursue and win business in our [Cost of Tender spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdGlNeVc4djhRVUd0d0lTYjBSTDJJS3c#gid=0). This is later reviewed during the Management Reviews.

**Daily hours**

All staff should record their times via [Harvest](https://mearra.harvestapp.com/time). Simply record your time each day against each project you work on. Usually this is only one project. Harvest produces reports that we use for invoicing.

**Expenses**

Expenses should be submitted by emailing receipts to *uk.finance@wunder.uk*. If your expense relates to a particular project then explain how much goes to which project so that the costs can be allocated.

**Project Costs & Availability**

For reporting we record the details of sprints, staff, availability and budget vs actual in our [Schedule of costs and availability](https://docs.google.com/a/wunderkraut.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahb4YZjQwNDgdGYyNGpyZ0pGM3RHN2tOcEFrUnNEUUE#gid=1) spreadsheet. This is stored in the project folder in Google Drive.

It's important that we all record times and costs accurately. This data is used to calculate our own efficiencies, to determine future project costs and for forecasting.
